# Machine Learning Classification

   * Describe the input and output of a classification model.
   * Tackle both binary and multiclass classification problems.
   * Implement a logistic regression model for large-scale classification.  
   * Create a non-linear model using decision trees.
   * Improve the performance of any model using boosting.
   * Scale your methods with stochastic gradient ascent.
   * Describe the underlying decision boundaries.  
   * Build a classification model to predict sentiment in a product review dataset.  
   * Analyze financial data to predict loan defaults.
   * Use techniques for handling missing data.
   * Evaluate your models using precision-recall metrics.
   * Implement these techniques in Python Notebook
